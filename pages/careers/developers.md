We are growing! With new projects and lots of exciting technologies, our team is looking for passionate and talented software developers across the entire stack to continue building cutting edge tools and infrastructures used by cancer researchers around the globe to fight cancer.

Our open source applications handle vast amounts of data (2+ PB) and run on large compute environments. Designed and implemented by our in-house developers, we maintain a diverse set of tools and projects, from complex ETL systems to modern user interfaces.

[ICGC-DCC](https://github.com/icgc-dcc), our most mature and well known project, is a submission system, ETL pipeline and data portal coordinating cancer research on 89 projects with participants from all over the world. With [ICGC-ARGO](https://icgcargo.org/), ICGC is entering a new phase with very interesting software engineering challenges ahead of us, such as providing researchers with access to 100's billions of genetic variants. We are also building the front-end and some of the API for [NCI Genomic Data Commons](https://github.com/NCI-GDC), a US-based unified data repository that enables data sharing across cancer genomic studies. Our team also operates the [Cancer Genome Collaboratory](https://github.com/CancerCollaboratory), a compute and storage cloud which we progressively enhance with more tools to assist researchers running analysis pipelines. 
[Kids First](https://github.com/kids-first/), our most recent project aims at facilitating collaboration on the research of childhood cancer and structural birth defects. Last but not least, our team recently released [HCMI](https://github.com/nci-hcmi-catalog/portal), a searchable catalog of cancer models.

As part of the team you, the successful candidate will be joining some of the above-mentioned projects, but also be contributing to [Overture.bio](https://www.overture.bio/), our suite of open-source components for big data genomic science.

We are looking for passionate candidates from a wide set of seniority levels  to join our agile development teams. If you feel comfortable with some of the technologies mentioned below, please get in touch and tell us about yourself!
